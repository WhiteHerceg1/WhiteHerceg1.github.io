    <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
    <P>Hi,My name is Aren.I was born on April 14, 2004 in Vanadzor,Lori region.I am currently studying in the first year of the Faculty of Informaticks and Applied Mathematicks at the French University in Armenia.I have been interested in the field of programming since I was a child,but,unfortunately,I did not attend classes.I think that delving into this field years ago would have made the process of acquiring new knowledge easier now, but I don't lose motivation because I entered a university that will allow me to fill in what I missed before. In the future, I want to see myself as a good specialist in the field of programming.My goal is to see my homeland as a leader in this field and to contribute to it with my effective activity.
